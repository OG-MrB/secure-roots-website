# (Cyber) Criminals Have Jobs Too

Every day, somewhere in the world, someone’s credentials are sold before their morning coffee brews.  
Not because they were famous. Not because they were rich.  
Because their data was *available*.  

Cybercrime has matured into an industry with HR departments, customer service, performance metrics, and profit goals. These aren’t lone wolves in dark rooms anymore — they’re professionals with quotas, bonuses, and a business plan. They’ve made cybercrime a career.  
And your identity is the product line.

## The Profession of Crime  

Think of today’s threat actors as a workforce. There are developers writing malware, brokers auctioning stolen credentials, negotiators handling ransom payments, and marketing teams designing phishing campaigns that look exactly like your company’s real emails.  

Cybercrime isn’t chaos — it’s commerce.  
And just like legitimate businesses, criminals want maximum return on minimal effort. That means targeting whoever’s easiest to breach — not whoever’s biggest.  

By 2025, the global cost of cybercrime will surpass **$10.5 trillion** annually.  
It’s not an underground problem anymore; it’s a parallel economy.

## Why You’re Already a Target  

There’s a dangerous myth that smaller companies and everyday individuals “don’t have anything worth stealing.”  
But the data says otherwise:  

- Nearly **half of all data breaches** hit small and midsize organizations.  
- Over **60% of those businesses close within six months** of the attack.  
- **53% of breaches** involve personal information — the digital DNA of identity.  

Cybercriminals don’t chase prestige. They chase opportunity. They run scans for misconfigurations, open ports, and weak passwords. If you appear on their screen, you’re already on the list.

## The Currency of Identity  

Identity has replaced gold, oil, and cash as the most liquid commodity on earth.  
A username and password might sell for a few dollars; a full identity — with bank logins and tax records — for hundreds.  

Every time a password is reused or an employee clicks a fake login page, that identity joins the supply chain of the cyber underground.  
One actor steals it, another buys it, a third monetizes it.  
It’s specialization, division of labor — the same principles that make your business efficient — weaponized against you.

## The Human Factory  

Groups like **Lapsus$** didn’t need elite zero-day exploits to breach tech giants; they used **MFA fatigue**, **insider recruitment**, and **phishing**.  
They didn’t break in through code — they walked in through people.  

Attackers run social engineering the way marketers run ad campaigns: A/B testing subject lines, refining scripts, automating outreach.  
It’s not personal. It’s pipeline.  

That’s why Secure Roots focuses on the human layer — the point where technology meets trust. Because defending systems means defending people first.

## Professional Defense for Professional Crime  

If the attackers have professionalized, your defenses must too.  
Security can’t be an afterthought or a once-a-year audit. It has to be a living practice — measured, refined, and embedded in your culture.  

Start with identity:  
- Strong, unique passwords and password managers.  
- Multi-factor authentication that isn’t a reflex click.  
- Continuous credential leak monitoring.  
- Zero-trust access controls.  
- Regular tabletop exercises and recovery drills.  

These are the habits of resilient organizations — the ones that survive the storm while others wonder how it happened.  

---

## The Optics of Strength  

When customers, investors, or partners look at your company, security is part of what they *see*.  
A breach isn’t just a technical failure; it’s an optics crisis.  
It says, “We weren’t prepared.”  

At Secure Roots, we help organizations project — and prove — resilience. Because reputation is built in peace and tested in chaos. The strongest roots aren’t visible, but they hold everything in place when the storm hits.

## Closing  

Cybercriminals are professionals.  
They plan. They measure. They execute.  

So must we.  
They’ve made cybercrime a career.  
**Make security your culture.**
